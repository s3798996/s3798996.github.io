									<p> What is your interest in IT? </p>
									<p> -Designing a practical UI for the users along with debugging software nor operating my ‘own’ operating system </p>
									<p>When did your interest in IT start?</p>
									<p>My passion began when I started interacting with Dreamweaver from grade 10 and the first tutorial was about adding text into the system and the fundamental theory on Dreamweaver. At first, it was not very amusing for me until 2 weeks later, I was asked to form a page by using Dreamweaver. During the process, I have looked through multiple sources on the internet about constructing the page. And as I went through the activity, I feel very inspired whenever I’m doing programming or searching for information about technology. From that moment, I started listening to multiple Youtubers such as BitWit, MKBHD, LinusTechTips, Austin Evans and JayTwoCents </p>
									<p>Within that experience, I began building my own personal desktop using all the knowledge that I have gathered from the Tech Youtubers to online tutorials. The process of building the PC is a bit challenging but I had a lot of fun during that progress </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Why did you choose <br />
										to come to RMIT</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/RMIT.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> -The reason that I choose this particular institution for my bachelor’s degree was that it is considered as the only university with an English speaking environment. Plus, I am comfortable communicating in English than Vietnamese despite being born and raised from a pure Vietnamese parent without any other ancestry besides Chinese. </p>
									<p> -Another minor aspect that the institution provides an international degree which  can apply to any countries whenever seeking for a job perspective or meeting the university requirement in order to enter the master degree course of Computer Science or Information Technology</p>

									<p>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p>
									<p> - Knowledge about different programming languages such as Java, C++, JavaScript, Program C and Swift</p>
									<p> - Fundamental aspects of cloud computing and security networking</p>
									<p> - Method of debugging an applications</p>
									<p> - Teamwork experience</p>
									<p> - Apps developing skills</p>
									<p> - Patience and Stability</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Conclusion about <br />
										myself *this is not egoistic*</a></h2>
									</header> 
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/p2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> Firts of all , i am not considered myself as an excellent student nor entertaining as the others . The reason why i enrolled myself into class is that i have a pure passion for technology ,even though i am slow but i have a high level of comitment that would be able to pass through the upcomig obstacles .</p>
									<p> Nonetheless, i dont usually aiming for a bold HD score that will not likely to be put into my record . But rather that im bascially doing what i love and ....</p>
									<p> I AM HAPPY </p>
									<p> AND THAT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME</p>
